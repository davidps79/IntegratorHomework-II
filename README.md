A Colombian television channel wants to enter the streaming audiovisual distribution business and is preparing to go into production in a few months. To achieve this objective they have been negotiating the rights of several films and series, some Colombian, Latin American and Spanish. It is also managing the production of this audiovisual material with its own resources.

They would like to have an application that allows them to interact with their subscribers in a more efficient way, so they have decided to contract the development of an application that solves the administration of the audiovisual catalog (films and series) and at the same time allows the registration and interaction of their subscribers.
